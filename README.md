**🧠 Pixel Bot: Image Captioning using GEN-AI**

Welcome to Pixel Bot! Bringing your images to life with AI-generated captions!

**✨ Aim**
The aim of this mini-project is to deepen my understanding of transformers and their application in image generation. I intend to explore generative AI techniques, leveraging state-of-the-art models to create and manipulate images, thereby gaining practical insights into their capabilities and potential use cases.

**🌟 Features**
Accurate Image Captioning: Utilizes a robust Vision Encoder-Decoder model to generate precise and contextually relevant captions for images.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation and usage.
Real-Time Captions: Get instant captions by uploading your images.
Interactive Experience: Engage with the model and see how it interprets different images.
